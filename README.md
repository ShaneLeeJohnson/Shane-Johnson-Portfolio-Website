# Shane Johnson Portfolio Website

## Description

This portfolio website is essentially my resume in website form. I have sections with info about myself, the skills I feel confident in, a resume section and all of my contact info. Not only does the skills section showcase the different Web-Development skills I feel confident with, the entire website is a testament to my Web-Development abilities. I used a bootstrap template to find a layout that I liked and then made all of the necessary changes to personalize the website until I had something that I liked and showed off my style as a developer.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this website, the user just has to follow the link and can either scroll down the page to view the different sections or they can use the sidebar to navigate to a specific section that they are interested in. The social icons under my name in the sidebar can also be clicked on to take the user to the respective websites to see more information about me.
